Cumulus Web Services Library
============================

This is a project in its very early stages to write a PHP library for the Digital Asset Management Software "Canto Cumulus". You can use its Web Service functionality only if you have installed the Web Publisher.

Since there is no documentation or examples on the net, I hope this is of use to someone.

The first out-of-the-box working version is scheduled to April 15th 2009.

Example Usage (only working in CakePHP Controller at this time)
===============================================================
<?php
function cumulusExample() {
	loadModel('Cumulus'); $this->Cumulus = new Cumulus();
	
	$query = '"Asset Name" "starts with" "abc" AND "Categories" == "def"';
	$records = $this->Cumulus->getRecordData($query, array('Categories', 'Asset Modification Date', 'Asset Name'));
	
	return $records;
}
?>

I have nothing to do with Canto, Inc. (the vendor of Cumulus)
